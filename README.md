## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.16.0 or higher)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (3.0.0 or higher)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development, macOS only)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for Firebase setup)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hassan689/connect-open-source.git
cd connect-open-source
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Messaging
3. Install FlutterFire CLI:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```
4. Configure Firebase for your project:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   This will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase configuration.
5. Download the configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
6. Place the files in the appropriate directories:
   - Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
   - iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

**⚠️ Important:** The `firebase_options.dart` file contains your Firebase API keys and should NOT be committed to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   # OpenAI (for AI features)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   
   # Google Maps
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
   
   # Hugging Face (for AI features)
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
   ```

3. **⚠️ Never commit the `.env` file** - it's already in `.gitignore`

### 5. Google Maps Setup

1. Get a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Maps SDK for Android and iOS
3. Add the API key to your `.env` file (see step 4)
4. **For Android:** Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with your actual key
5. **For iOS:** Add the key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` (see Firebase setup)

**Note:** The API key in AndroidManifest.xml needs to be set manually as Android doesn't support environment variables directly.

### 6. Run the App

```bash
# For Android
flutter run

# For iOS (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios

# For Web
flutter run -d chrome
```
